# Crystal Quine

This is a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29) written in [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).  
Most of the files have been generated using `crystal init app`

There is even a spec, that checks that the program is really a quine.
Run it using `crystal spec`.

To build the quine use `shards build` and execute `./bin/crystal-quine` afterwards.
